[1.2] Tokens in Python

The smallest individual unit in a program is known as a token or lexical unit.

	keywords: list them using help() in cmd
	
	Identifiers: Myfile, DATE9_7_2014, _CHK, FILE13
	
	Literals/Values:
		String Literals:
			Single Line Strings:""
			Multi-Line Strings: "Hello\
								World"
			No backslash String: ''' Hello
								World 
								Welcom to Computer Tutor

		Numeric Literals: int()

		Boolean Literals: True, False

		Special Literal: None

	Operators: 
		Arithmetic Operators: +,-,*,/,%,**,//
		Bitwise Operators: &, ^, |
		Shift Operators: <<, >>
		Identity Operators: is, is not
		Relational Operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
		Logical Operators: and, or
		Assignment: Operator: =
		Membership Operator: in, not in
		Arithmetic-Assignment Operator: /=, +=, -=, */, %=, **=,//
	
	Punctuators: ' " # \ [ ] { } @ , : . ` =

[1.4] Variable & Assignments
	
	Assignment Types:
		Dynamic Typing:
			x = 10
			print(x)
			x = "Hello World"
			print(x)
		
		Multiple Assignments:
			a=b=c=10
			print(a)
			print(b,c)

			a,b,c = 10, 20, 30
			print(a,b,c)
			a,b = b,a 
			print(a,b,c)



[1.5] I/O in Python

Input in Python:

	variable = input (message to be displayed on screen)

	name = input ("What's your name?")
	print(name)
	type(name)

	age = input ("What's your age?")
	print(age)
	type(age)

	Is python stupid? Nope. Input() will always return a str object

	2 options for you to change the output:
	age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
	print(age)
	type(age)

	marks = float(int("Enter your marks: "))
	print(marks)
	type(marks)



Output in Python:

Formula: print(*objects, [sep='' or end='']) #sep can be blank, any string and end can have escaping characters (\n).


	print("hello, world")
	print ("hello,", "world")
	print(17.5)
	print(3.14159*(r*r))
	print("I\'ve got", 90+5, "marks in Python because of CT.")

	Note: Print statement auto-converts the output item to strings. Numeric values are computed but converted to strings before they're printed.

	sep argument in print()

	print("I", "learn", "from", "Computer", "Tutor.", sep='...')
	print("I", "learn", "from", "Computer", "Tutor.", sep='###')
	
	What will happen without a sep argument?

	print("I", "learn", "from", "Computer", "Tutor.")
	# By default sep is blank space
	
	end argument in print()

	print("My name is Ankit and I learn from", end='#')
	print("Computer-Tutor")

	What will happen without an end argument?
	
	print("My name is Ankit and I learn from")
	print("Computer-Tutor")
	# by default end is \n -> new line character

[1.6] Data Types in Python

Data Types for Numbers:
	
	Integers
		Integers (signed): +15, -7
		Boolean: True or False
	Floating point numbers: 1.14 (upto 15-digits)
	Complex numbers z = A+Bi (A - Real Part, Bi - Imaginary Part)
		z.real = A
		z.imag = Bi

Strings: "" - Strings -> Sequence of characters

Lists: Group of comma-seperated values of any data-type wthin []
	[10,9,8,7,6]
	['C', 'T']
	["Computer", "Tutor"]
	["Ankit", 24, "21-12-96"]

Tuples: Group of comma separated values of any data type within ()
	(1,2,3,4,5)
	('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
	('computer', 'tutor')

Dictionaries: It is unordered set of comma-separated key:value pairs, within {} where every key has to be unique.

	marks = {"Archit": 95, "Payanshi": 95}
	marks["Archit"]
	marks["Payanshi"]



[1.7] Mutable Vs Immutable Types

Immutable: The variable names are stores as references to a value-object. Each time you change the value, the variable's reference memory address changes. Eg: integers, floating point numbers, booleans, strings, tuples.

	a = 5
	b = a
	c = 5				reference changes, value doesn't
	.
	.
	.
	a = 10
	c = 7
	b = c

Mutable: In the same memory address, new value can be stored as and when you want. Eg:
	
	L = Lists
	S = Sets 			value changes, refrence doesn't
	D = Dictionary

	RollNo = [1, 2, 3]
	RollNo[1] = 40




[1.8] Expressions and Evaluation

Evaluating Arithmetic Operations:
	
	What is the output and resulting data-type?

	a,b=3,9
	c = b/a 

	a,b = 3,6.0
	c = b%a

	12 //4 + 2 ** 4 - 5

	3 + (4 â€” (11 // 5))** 2 % 2



Evaluating Relational Expressions:
All comparison operations in python have the same priority, which is lower than that of any arithmetic operations. Output of all relational expression is bool values.

Chained expressions:
	a<b<c : a<b and b<c
	p<=q<=r : p<=q and q<=r




Evaluating Logical Expressions:

Precedence of logical operators is lower than arithmetic operators
	25/5 or 2.0 + 20/10 = 5 or 4.0
Precedence among logical operators is
	not > and > or
Python minimizes internal work:
	or - Python only evaluates the 2 argument if first is false
	and - Python only evaluates the 2 argument if first is true

Guess the program output?
	(5<10) and (10<5) or (3<18) and not (8<18) = ?



Math Library Functions
It's a python standard library function for math related functons that work with type of numbers except complex numbers.

	import math
	math.<function_name>

	Functions:
		ceil - math.ceil(num)
		sqrt - math.sqrt(num)
		exp - math.exp(arg)
		fabs - math.fabs(num)
		floor - math.floor(num)
		log - math.log(num,base)
		log10 - math.log10(num)
		pow - math.pow(base,exp)
		sin - math.sin(arg)
		cos - math.cos(arg)
		tan - math.tan(arg)
		degrees - math.degrees(x)
		radians - math.radians(x)


[1.9] Statement Flow Control
Sequential, Selective & Iterative Statement

Simple Statement:
	name = input("Enter your name:")
	age = 21
	print ("Age of ",name, "", "is ", age)


Compound Statement:
	name = input("Enter your name:")
	marks = 95
	tuition = "Computer Tutor"
	if (marks>90):
		print("You studied from ", tuition)
	else:
		print("You studied from ordinary tuition.")


Empty Statement:
	It's a pass statement.
	def anyFunction():
		pass

	if (marks>90):
		print("You've achieved a distinction.")	
	else:
		pass

PS: Example for statement flow control using empty statement in Idle.


The IF-Conditionals
3 Kinds in Python:
	If
	If-Else
	If-Elif-Else

Plain IF-Conditional in Python
	if (marks>90):
		print("You achieved a distinction!")

If-Else Conditional in Python
	if (marks>90):
		print("You achieved a distinction")
	else:
		print("You didn't achieve any distinction")

If-Elif Conditional in Python
	if (marks>90):
		print("You achieved a distinction")
	elif (marks>80):
		print("You didn't achieve any distinction but 80+")
	elif (marks>70):
		print("You didn't achieve any distinction but 70+")
	else:
		print("You've scored less than 70!")

PS: Example for different conditional types in Python in Idle.



[1.11] Looping Statements

FOR LOOP:

General form of FOR loop:
	
	for <variable> in <sequence>:
		Statements_to_repeat

Sequence -> [10,20,30,40]

	for a in [10,20,30,40]:
		print(a+2, end='')
	
	Output ?


range() function 

	General formula:
		range(start, stop, step)

This is only for number based lists.
It stores values in lists.

	x = range(3,18) # [3,4,5,6.....,17]
	print(x[1])
	print(x[2])
	print(x[7])

	start  = first element
	print(x[0])

	stop = last element # stop-1
	print(x[-1])

	step = difference between to consecutive values
	Note: Increment in nature by default

	range(13)
	range(2,12)
	range(5,13,2)
	range(20,5)
	range(20,5,-5)

	PS:
	1. The start value is always a part of range() and stop value is never a part of range()
	2. If start value is omitted, it is supposed to be 0.
	3. If step value is omitted, it is supposed to be 1.

	[Do it now] Ques: Write a program to print cubes of numbers in range 15 to 20.

	[Homework] Ques: Write a program to print square root of every alternate number in the range 1 to 10.


WHILE Loop:

General Formula:
	
	while <logical_expression>:
		loop_body

PS: Until when the logical expression is True, the statement(s) within the loop executes.
